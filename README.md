One of the Most interesting project that I have done. The main goal was to design a c language compiler(in c :) ) and his Microprocessor in VHDL. To be sure that the assembly code generated by the compiler is running perfectly, we have also developed an interpreter.  


## To compile the compiler
```bash
  cd compilateur
  ./compile_compilateur
```

## To compile The interpreter
```bash
  cd interpreteur
  ./compile	
```

## To run a test case
  write the test case in the folder dossierTest
  to compile the test case(ie generate the assembly code of your example)
  
  ```bash
    cd compilateur
    ./hakunaMatata ../dossiertest/nameOfTestCaseFile.c ../dossiertest/nameOfAnOutputFile
    ```

  the output file name will contain the assembly code
