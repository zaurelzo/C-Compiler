One of the Most interesting project that I have done. The main goal was to design a c Language Compiler(in c :) ) and his Microprocessor
in VHDL. To validate that the code which is generate by the compiler is running perfectly, we have also developed an interpreter.  


## To compile the compiler
  cd compilateur
  ./compile_compilateur

## To compile The interpreter
  cd interpreteur
  ./compile
